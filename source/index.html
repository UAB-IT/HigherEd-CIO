		<h3>Initiatives</h3>
		<p>The Alabama Higher Ed CIO Council recognizes the need for information network services in the state of Alabama. The group has introduced a strategy considering a holistic view of these services to include but not necessarily limited to:</p>
		<div class="grid col-1 col-2-m col-3-l">
			<div>
				<h4>Education</h4>
				<p>Emerging and future technological advances are likely to continue and accelerate the integration of information technology into the practice of education as well as into the organization, operation, management and administration of the education enterprise.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Healthcare Services</h4>
				<p>Infrastructure, quality education, critical mass of technical human capital, quality health services, and quality of life are key factors within the technoloty-related sector that the State of Alabama can focus on to enhance its economic position and improve the health of the citizens of Alabama.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Public Safety and Emergency Services</h4>
				<p>Providing effective and affordable systems to help ensure public safety is an important dimension of public policy. Transportation systems, traffic safety systems, medical services, fire and rescue services all involve and are increasingly dependent on network services for their processes.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>General Services</h4>
				<p>The State of Alabama operates offices in communities state-wide and provides a wide range of public administration services to the state’s citizens. Coordinating the work of these offices and establishing a foundation for modernization will open opportunies for more economical and citizen-friendly delivery of state services.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Defense and Homeland Security</h4>
				<p>Threats to our national security are ever growing and include sophisticated cyber attacks against our most critical infrastructure and systems. These threats can only be mitigated through effective partnerships and sharing ideas, research results, threat assessments, and breakthroughs in near real time.</p>
